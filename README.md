# Automated-Email-Scheduler Test
Send an email via Gmail and schedule it using the schedule library.

## Prerequisites  
  
### Install Required Libraries  
You need to install the `schedule` library. You can install it using pip:  
  
```bash  
pip install schedule  
```  
  
### Enable "Less secure app access  
In your Gmail account, enable the option "Allow less secure apps". This can be found in the security settings of your Google account.  
  
> **Note**: Using your Gmail account password is not recommended due to security concerns. It's better to use an app-specific password or OAuth 2.0 for authentication.  
  
## Usage  
  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-email-scheduler.git  
   cd automated-email-scheduler
